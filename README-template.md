## My process
- Learn about CSS Flexbox
- Start from HTML and group the elements into their respective classes
- Start styling them using CSS based on the specification
- Implement CSS Flexbox to simplify the box positioning
- Experiment with the width for optimum display based on the resolution provided in the specification
- Ensuring that the width of the two flexbox items are more than the specified resolution on mobile view so the box will automatically be stacked vertically
- Creating the button using a CSS Button Creator website (link provided below)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS button creator

### What I learned

How to use basic CSS flexbox, first exposure to real-life project.

### Continued development

- How to master the use of flex container's width and its flex items width properties (static vs dynamic use)
- Creating variables to change one variable instead of multiple variables manually
- Alternative for IDs 
- Streamlining or concising the code to avoid unnecessary codes
